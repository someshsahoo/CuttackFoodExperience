        <h3>~Topic exploration and selection~</h3>
    <p>DIfferent topic spaces were viewed to see which topic can be well represented
        through the InfoViz. Being a foodie and having a domain knowledge on the same, I wanted to explore the food space more. Merging that knowledge with my native city Cuttack’s food joints, I wanted to create a food journey experience of Cuttack.
        The idea was to highlight the food experience that Cuttack can and have been
        providing to its citizens and people visiting it.
    </p>

    <h3>~Gathering and refining domain knowledge~</h3>
    <p>Being my native place, I knew most things about the food joints and 
        restaurants that are there. Apart from that I researched more
        about the food joints and the cuisines evolution - how new cuisines started getting into the mainstream food palate of the citizen.
        Reading on the food history of Cuttack and how places of gathering and
        eating evolved from small food stalls to mid and high end restaurants.</p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h3>~Data collection and insight exploration~</h3>
    <p>I started scraping restaurant information from <a href = https://www.swiggy.com>Swiggy</a>'s website.
        The data was collected and cleaned in an excel sheet
        and basic charts were made to see the patterns and insights that can be seen and explored further

            <small>insight analysis of basic charts</small><br><br>
        </div>
    <br><br>
    
    <h3>~Creating narrative and structuring the page~</h3>
    <p>The narrative of Cuttack’s food experience through its own words gives a
        humane touch to the statistical information visualisation. The story of it’s food evolution through visual graphics, interaction and data creates a playful merge of data story.
        The layout and the structure of the webpage was sketched out and
        different views were prepared to see the initial visualisation.
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container">

            <small>rough layout of cuisine location InfoViz</small><br><br>
        </div>
    <br><br>
    
    <h3>~Creating visualisations and compositions~</h3>
    <p>Once the layout was finalised, the typography, colors and the composition of
        the data visualisations were finalised and the final data visualisation were
        prepared. Figma was used for this and interactive visualisation. 
        </p>

        </div>
    <br>

    <h3>~Putting it all together~</h3>
    <p>All the creatives along with the story were put together on a
        simple webpage created using HTML and CSS that you viewed <a href = cuttack-food-experience.html>here</a> ;)
