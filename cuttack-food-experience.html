                a particular culture is clustered.</h6>
            <p>Since begining, I've been sheltering people from different cultures. The food they
                made and served created a sense of unity in diversity and community!

            <h3>One Place, Many Taste</h3>
            <p>Don't worry if your mind changes for a different cuisines after you've reached at your
                decided restaurant. Most of my restaturants serve more than 2 - 3 cuisines.
                Any restaurant you go, youâ€™ll always find a dish, a cuisine to satiate your taste buds.
                The following visual flaunts it :p
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="card"><img class="card" src="chart.jpg"></div>

            <h3>These Dishes ðŸ¥º ; My Heart ðŸ’˜ </h3>
            <h6>Few dishes are enjoyed right when it's served and it doesn't taste the
                same when delivered at home. Here are few of those dishes.
            </h6>
            <p>The narrative of Cuttackâ€™s food experience through its own words gives a
            humane touch to the statistical information visualisation. The story of itâ€™s food evolution through visual graphics, interaction and data creates a playful merge of data story.
            The layout and the structure of the webpage was sketched out and
            different views were prepared to see the initial visualisation.

            <h3>~Creating visualisations and compositions~</h3>
            <p>Once the layout was finalised, the typography, colors and the composition of
            the data visualisations were finalised and the final data visualisation were
            prepared. Figma was used for this and interactive visualisation.
