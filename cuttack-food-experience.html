            <h3>I, Me and My Food Culture</h3>
            <p>I'm a small city in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. I'm on a peninsula flanked by the Mahanadi River to the north and
                the Kathajodi River to the south. The ruins of moated Barabati Fort, once home to the Eastern Ganga dynasty, shows my medieval significance.
                I've been greatly influenced by the food culture of Jagannath temple and my food variations shows the same.
                
                From sweet to savoury, firm to mellow, tangy to soothing, you'll get all the flavours here.
                <br><br>Creating a balance between the local cuisine and the opening up my arms for world cuisines,
                I'm still on a phase to learn taste and develop new palate for new cuisines. 
                Recently food delivery has started here and I'm excited for the same. It's new and I want you to 
                go on my Food trip with me! 
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>I'll never dissapoint your taste buds. Try different cuisines all around!</h3>
            <p>I serve to you a plethora of cuisines to try. From Chinese to American,
                North to South Indian, whatever you wish to have is readily available at your service.
            </p>

            <h3>Went Global holding to my roots</h3>
            <p>Since begining, I've been sheltering people from different cultures. The food they
                made and served created a sense of unity in diversity and community!

            <h3>One Place, Many Taste</h3>
            <p>Don't worry if your mind changes for a different cuisines after you've reached at your
                decided restaurant. Most of my restaturants serve more than 2 - 3 cuisines.
                Any restaurant you go, you‚Äôll always find a dish, a cuisine to satiate your taste buds.
                The following visual flaunts it :p

            <h3>These Dishes ü•∫ ; My Heart üíò </h3>
            <p>Few dishes are enjoyed right when it's served and it doesn't taste the
                same when delivered at home.
                Giving you Few of my dishes that you must try when you visit me. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p class="subhead">DahiBara AlooDum</p>
            <p>You can take me away from DahiBara AlooDum but you can't take DahiBara AlooDum
                away from my heart. It's one of those dishes of mine that sits on the throne of dishes.
                No trip to me is ever complete without you having a plate of this lip smacking delicacy.
                The dish has an enormous cult following. The Bara (vada) are soaked in thhinner buttermilk with a
                splash of curry leaves and mustard sauted. The marriage of these with thicker AlooDum gravy
                topped with chopped onions, sev, spice mix, chutney and coriander is what makes this combination heart warming and filling. 
                <br><br>
                The distinctive taste of Dahibara AlooDum in Cuttack can never be replicated
                outside my realms however the recipe has travelled throughout that State of Odisha (and beyond)!

            <p class="subhead">Cuttacki Biriyani</p>
            <p>My biriyani is a unique blend of biriyani flavours coming from 3 different 
                regions of India - Awadhi , Hyderabadi and Kolkata biriyani. The addition of khoya, saffron milk
                and deep fried white onions gives the sweeter tinge to the all so savoury mix of meat and rice.
                With the delicate mix of spices and the half opened and half Dum style of cooking gives it a taste which is heaven to eat.
                Served with cool raita and a side of sald, this dish is perfect comfort food. Sitting at one place, enjoy the taste of many, as said before.
                Whenever you come here, have a try at this because, I can guarentee one thing<br><em><strong>Pait bhar jayega, par dil nahi bharega</strong></em> <br>(Your tummy will be full but not your greed).</p>
